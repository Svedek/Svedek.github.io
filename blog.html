						I joined the Godot Wild Jam #62 and made a video on the process!

						I have been interested in game dev-y video production for a bit now and I finally gave it a go. I learned a lot doing it, but that came at the cost of having gone about the production in a <strong>very</strong> inefficient manner. I essentially recorded every moment that I was working on the project and ended up with close to 17 hours of footage. This was a bit of a nightmare to go through when I was also getting caught up with other coursework. The jam happened to be right in the middle of midterms so I had some other obligations, as a result the game and video took a bit of a sideline for a while. I got through it though and I'm really happy with the video, however I do wish I had more time for the game itself.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am also still working on The Seeker, albeit slowly and infrequently. I plan on finishing both The Seeker and the contract reaper game, making another video of it when I continue work on the contract reaper game. That said I have no timeline for when any of this will happen. I love working on these little games, but I have a very packed semester at university and I work on these projects when I’m done with classwork and have the remaining energy to work on them.

						Thank you for reading, I’ll update when I have progress to share!

						I have finally finished the main blog page (c:) and have a rough plan drawn up for the remaining pages. The stylesheets used for this blog should suit the other pages with a few tweeks, meaning they will probably come out a whole lot faster. I still want to set up an about me page, a home page, a projects page, and an art gallery page.
					<p>
						University has also begun and thus I may not be able to work as readily on side projects, though I still plan on finishing my current game project: The Seeker. Of which I had to scale back as my vision kept growing and now I am focusing on exclusively what was in the original plan. The game will be a top-down singular boss fight with some additional stuff that I will reveal later. The player is almost entirely complete, though I still have to complete the boss, menus, sounds, transitions, and almost certainly bugs / unexpected things.
					</p>
					<p>
						I plan on updating this blog roughly twice a month, though we’ll see how that works out. I also plan on joining game jams that come up and making a lot more smaller games and projects. Either way though, I’ll update later and see where I am, thanks for reading <3.

						This marks day 3 of sticking to learning web development and the start of this blog. I feel like im making decent progress with HTML and CSS. I am also excited to learn more about SQL and JS.
					</p>
					<p>
						I made this website as an exercise in web development, but I'm enjoying making it and im mostly happy with how its looking.
