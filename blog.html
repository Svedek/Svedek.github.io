					I have finally finished the main blog page (c:) and have a rough plan drawn up for the remaining pages. The stylesheets used for this blog should suit the other pages with a few tweeks, meaning they will probably come out a whole lot faster. I still want to set up an about me page, a home page, a projects page, and an art gallery page.
					<br><br>
					University has also begun and thus I may not be able to work as readily on side projects, though I still plan on finishing my current game project: The Seeker. Of which I had to scale back as my vision kept growing and now I am focusing on exclusively what was in the original plan. The game will be a top-down singular boss fight with some additional stuff that I will reveal later. The player is almost entirely complete, though I still have to complete the boss, menus, sounds, transitions, and almost certainly bugs / unexpected things.
					<br><br>
					I plan on updating this blog roughly twice a month, though we’ll see how that works out. I also plan on joining game jams that come up and making a lot more smaller games and projects. Either way though, I’ll update later and see where I am, thanks for reading <3.

				<p class="post-body">This marks day 3 of sticking to learning web development and the start of this blog. I feel like im making decent progress with HTML and CSS. I am also excited to learn more about SQL and JS.<br><br>
				I made this website as an exercise in web development, but I'm enjoying making it and im mostly happy with how its looking.
